A node.js module that provides access to the VIPS library and Exiv2 in order
to resize and rotate images.

Updated from node-waf to node-gyp.

Tested with VIPS 7.32.1.

Homebrew users note: vips and exiv2 have moved to homebrew/science, to use run
`brew tap homebrew/science` then run `brew install vips` and `brew install
exiv2` as normal.
